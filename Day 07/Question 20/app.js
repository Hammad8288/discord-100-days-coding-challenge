//Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ['pakistan', 'india', 'america', 'afghanistan', 'turkey'];
console.log("List Of Countries");
for (var _i = 0, countries_1 = countries; _i < countries_1.length; _i++) {
    var country = countries_1[_i];
    console.log(country);
}
;
